Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts.

Chief Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department, Akane Tsunemori, receives a report of an incident on a foreign vessel – the body of Professor Milicia Stronskaya has been discovered.

The Stronskaya Papers could reveal a truth that would shake Japan's government, and even the Sibyl System, to the core.

To make matters worse, he cannot request a meeting with the headmaster of the college, who may be the only person that knows anything pertaining to the disappearance. The only ones in frequent contact with the headmaster are the heads of the college dormitories, known as the Prefect 4 (P4): Edgar Redmond, Lawrence Bluewer, Herman Greenhill, and Gregory Violet.<br>\n<br>\nCiel must concoct a plan to get in the P4's good graces if he wants to use their connections to succeed in his mission. But the distinguished college and its students hide much that is unseen, making this task more improbable than he could imagine.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",
